**<font size="5"><u>Subject Overview</u></font>**


The purpose of learning MTL at primary school is to equip our students with literacy skills that will enable them to harness opportunities in the future as bilingual individuals. MTL teachers adopt differentiated teaching approaches to cater to the needs of students from different home language backgrounds. To ignite students’ joy of learning MTL, PGPS provides a broad range of MTL learning experiences to help students discover their talents and interests.

The 3 MTL subjects offered at PGPS are Chinese Language, Malay Language and Tamil Language. At the end of Primary 6, students are expected to have a sound foundation in listening, speaking, reading and writing MTL, coupled with interaction skills that would enable them to use MTL for communication in their daily life. 

  

For lower primary students and students who need more support in MTL, the learning of oracy will precede the learning of reading and writing. For students at the higher levels and students with a stronger foundation in MTL, learning proceed from reading to oracy and writing. Students are provided with opportunities to progress to different levels of achievement during their primary school years.

**<font size="5"><u>Mission and Stage Outcomes</u></font>**


In alignment with the school’s direction, the mission of the PGPS MTL Department is to <font color="#538135" size="5">curate MTL experiences that are relevant, fun and integrated</font>. 

MTL teachers make intentional efforts to ignite the Joy of Learning (JOL), leverage on EdTech to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of MTL learning, and integrate MTL with the Emerging 21st Century Competencies (E21CC).

At the Orientation Stage (Primary 1 and 2), MTL teachers focus on arousing students’ interest and inculcating good learning habits. At the Exploration Stage (Primary 3 and 4), students are exposed to a variety of MTL activities that allow them to discover and pursue their interests. At the Mastery Stage (Primary 5 and 6), MTL teachers empower students to apply MTL within and beyond the classroom with confidence.
