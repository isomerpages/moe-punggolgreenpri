Initiated by the Science department, PGPS’s E2K Science Programme aims to provide opportunities for our P4 and P5 young scientists to engage in scientific investigations to discover and deepen their understanding of advanced Science concepts through Inquiry approach. With collaborative-learning and guidance provided by our E2K Science teachers, our students are able to gain rich learning experiences which enable them to:  

● Develop the habits, attitudes and dispositions scientists possess.

● Gain important 21st century competencies such as resilience and resourcefulness, critical and inventive thinking, and effective communication skills.

Students in the E2K Science Programme are given opportunities to express their creativity, innovation, and dynamism at National Science Competitions such as Science Buskers Competition, Sony Creative Toy Competition.  Aligned with our school’s motto, “Be the best that we can be”, our E2K Science team believes in the importance of process. Hence, embarking on the Young Scientist Badge help to instill the keen interest in Science right from a young age. By focusing on the process, students are encouraged to have a growth mindset so that they can fully engage in learning and growing as they prepare for the competitions. This will in turn lead to greater mastery and ultimately, better performance.

The students took charge of the Science events and imparted their knowledge that they have learnt in E2K Science to the greater masses at school. In 2022, PGPS E2K Science YouTube channel was launched.

Inspiring our budding scientists to care for others in the community, character and citizenship education were emphasized during every E2K Science session. Our school’s core values of Self-discipline, Teamwork, Responsibility, Integrity, Valour and Empathy (S.T.R.I.V.E.) were ingrained in our students by reiterating and seizing every teachable moment.

**<u>Our Achievements</u>**

This year, we had a bumper crop of students from our E2K Science programme taking part in the Science buskers Competition. Organised by the A\*STAR and Singapore Science Centre, the competition aims to promote learning of Science in an engaging way as well as generating greater interest in creative Science and communications and expressions. Out of more than 200 teams from various schools which participated, 3 teams from PGPS were among the 25 teams shortlisted! We are proud to announce that 2 of the teams clinched the Judges Choice award.
