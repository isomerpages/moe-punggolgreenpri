Art Style Challenge 2017
------------------------

For Arts Fiesta this year, we had an enriching assembly programme at the end of a week of fun-filled activities, and learnt all about the history of Art and famous artists. In line with the assembly programme, we held a competition to see who was the most creative with just a simple line. Here are the winning pieces of our Art Style Challenge 2017!
