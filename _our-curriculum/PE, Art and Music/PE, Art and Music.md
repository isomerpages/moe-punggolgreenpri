**<font size=5><u>Physical Education & CCA at PGPS</u></font>**<br>

  

The Physical Education (PE) and Co-curricular Activities (CCA) department in PGPS aim to nurture future-ready leaders who continually pursue an active and healthy lifestyle.

  

The PE programme in PGPS aims to build a strong foundation for the development of broad-based physical competencies and opportunities for recreational participation. Anchored on our school values, our programme emphasizes on learning and enjoyment through developmentally appropriate movement experiences. 

  

Building upon the PE programme, the sports CCA programme provides opportunities for specialisation in a sport, as well as broad-based development within the specialised sport and across other sports. Together with other school programmes, physical education and sports CCA contribute to holistic education and the development of 21st Century Competencies to better prepare each individual to thrive in a VUCA (i.e., volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous) and highly-connected world.

  


**<font size=5><u>7 Key Learning Areas in Physical Education</u></font>**<br>

*   Athletics (From Primary 3) 
    
*   Dance 
    
*   Games and Sports 
    
*   Gymnastics 
    
*   Outdoor Education 
    
*   Physical Health and Fitness 
    
*   Swimming (Primary 3)
    

Primary 1 & 2 lessons focus on the exploration and mastery of fundamental motor skills such as locomotor, non-locomotor and manipulative skills with application of movement concepts to develop a strong foundation in movement. This provides the foundation for continual skill acquisition and facilitates future successful participation in physical activity.

Primary 3 & 4 lessons focus on the acquisition of broad-based skills and concepts (across and within physical activities and sports). Students will explore and learn more complex combinations and sequences of movements, and apply skills in more recognizable forms of sporting activities and games.

Primary 5 & 6 lessons focus on the development of physical-activity and/or sport-specific skills and tactics for sustained involvement based on interest and competencies. Moreover, students will develop games-related concepts for application through modified games under the following categories:

  

*   Target Games
    
*   Net-barrier Games
    
*   Striking-fielding Games
    
*   Territorial-invasion Games
    

  

**<font size=5><u>Aesthetics (Art and Music) at PGPS</u></font>**<br>
  

The Aesthetics department in PGPS aims to nurture expressive and passionate life-long practitioners of the arts. 

  

The PGPS Art curriculum enables every PGPS student to enjoy, appreciate art, develop and communicate visual literacy through creation. Through the integrated domains of See, Express and Appreciate, PGPS students are engaged through art discussions using inquiry approaches which promote a lifelong enjoyment for and an appreciation of artistic works whilst developing visual literacy.

Through musical experiences in the domains of Listening, Creating and Performing, students gain understanding and appreciation of musical elements and concepts within rich musical contexts across genres and traditions of local and global cultures and also develop awareness and ability for creative expression through music performance and music creation.

In PGPS, we are committed to create a vibrant culture of the arts in which students not only learn and appreciate but are also given various platforms to shine and showcase their talents. Hence, we believe that the arts is integral to the holistic development of our students and contributes to their development of the 21st Century Competencies that would better prepare them to face future challenges.

**<font size=5><u>Programme for Active Learning (PAL) at PGPS</u></font>**

To encourage learning beyond the classroom, the Primary 1 and 2 students experience Programme for Active Learning (PAL) during curriculum time. PAL lessons are a series of purposefully planned activities to provide the students with broad exposure and experiences in the four domains; Sports and Games, Outdoor Education, Performing Arts and Visual Arts. The activities facilitate the holistic development of the students in the five broad learning areas of physical, cognitive, social, aesthetics and moral. By equipping our students with the social and emotional competencies, it will better prepare every PGPS student to be a future-ready leader with the heart for others.
