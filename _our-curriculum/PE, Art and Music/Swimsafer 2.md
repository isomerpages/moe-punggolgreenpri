**Accessing E-certificate**

  

Dear parents,

You can now access your child’s SwimSafer 2.0 certificate via the web-based ActiveSG portal at

[http://members.myactivesg.com/auth](http://members.myactivesg.com/auth) once they pass both practical assessment and the corresponding online quiz on [https://members.myactivesg.com/swimsafer](https://members.myactivesg.com/swimsafer). Currently, the access to the E-certificates is only via web-based. The access through the ActiveSG App will be implemented later.

  

You will need to sign up as a member (if you have not done so) at [https://members.myactivesg.com/auth](https://members.myactivesg.com/auth) and tag your child as a supplementary member if he or she is below the age of 12 years old. Attached is the guide to ActiveSG membership sign up, tagging the child as a supplementary account and how to access the E-certificate for your reference.
