**<font size=6>Mathematics</font>**

**<font size=5>Department Vision:</font>**


Every PGPS student, a self-directed problem solver with a positive learning attitude, grounded in mathematical concepts and skills.

**<font size=5>Department Mission:</font>**


*   To ignite joy of learning Mathematics
*   To empower learners with strong Mathematical concepts, reasoning and communication skills
*   To nurture confident problem solvers with effective 21st century competencies

**<font size=5>Key Programmes</font>**

1.  Integrated Math Trails
2.  Termly Weekly Math Week
3.  Math Galore
4.  Learning Support for Mathematics (LSM)
5.  Improving Confidence and Achievement in Numeracy (ICAN)
6.  Excellence 2000 (E2K) Math

  

To ignite the joy and enthuse the students in the learning of Mathematics, we introduce a series of games and hands-on activities, through our Termly Weekly Math Week and Math Galore, to our students to help them master and apply their Mathematical concepts and knowledge without even realising it as they are immersed in the enjoyment of the games. We also provide concrete manipulatives in their daily lessons and create real-life experiences through Integrated Math Trails where they learn by experimentation and hands-on activities (sometimes recreating the environment with the aid of technology). Through these learning experiences, we empower learners with strong Mathematical concepts, reasoning and communication skills and nurture them to become confident problem solvers with effective 21st century competencies with the goal to attain excellence.

  

Each student is unique in his/her learning capabilities. In ensuring that no child is left out in the learning of Mathematics, we have a series of programmes catered to suit the learning needs of the different groups of students. The Learning Support Programmes (LSM and ICAN) aim to provide more focused help to support the identified students to strengthen their foundation in the early years. To further stretch the studentsâ€™ potentials, we have Excellence 2000 (E2K) Math in place which allows our students to explore Mathematical concepts in greater depth.
