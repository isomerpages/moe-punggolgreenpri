**<font size="5"><u>Department Mission</u></font>**<br>
To develop the competencies in the practices of Science and the spirit of scientific inquiry anchored on values.

**<font size="5"><u>Our Approach</u></font>**<br>
Based on the framework of the 5 Minds, we emphasize a balance between the acquisition of science knowledge, skills and attitudes. We engage students in authentic experiences that promote co-construction of knowledge, making the pursuit of science meaningful. Grounded in science knowledge and skills, we hope that our students can consciously relate their learning and actions to their role in the betterment of self, society and environment through the key programmes.

<u>Eco-Responsible lifestyle</u>  <br>
Our planting programme is conceptualized for our P3 students to learn a variety of urban farming techniques, such as vertical planting, hydroponic and aquaponics. Students cultivate social awareness on the problem of food scarcity in Singapore and how these urban farming techniques help mitigate it. In addition, the vegetables harvested were shared with the community as part of the students’ efforts to share and contribute actively. This aligns to our school’s total curriculum framework where students learn to be caring citizens.

<u>Learning beyond the classroom  </u><br>
Beyond the classroom, our students had fun learning about environmental issues. They played two engaging games from the Singapore Science Centre, exploring the impact of carbon emissions and the potential of clean energy. These games challenged students to think critically and find innovative solutions to achieve zero emissions​.

<u>Eco-Warrior Week </u><br>
Our signature Eco-Warrior Week is an annual programme that aligns with global environmental initiatives such as Earth Day and World Water Day. During this week, students participate in a diverse range of activities, from informative assembly to interactive workshops. These experiences foster a deep understanding of environmental issues and inspire students to become responsible citizens and lifelong learners.

<u>E2K Science </u><br>
PGPS’s E2K Science Programme aims to provide opportunities for our P4 and P5 young scientists to engage in scientific investigations to discover and deepen their understanding of advanced Science concepts through Inquiry approach.

With collaborative-learning and guidance provided by our E2K Science teachers, our students are able to gain rich learning experiences which enable them to:

● Develop the habits, attitudes and dispositions scientists possess.<br>
● Gain important 21st century competencies such as resilience and resourcefulness, critical and inventive thinking, and effective communication skills.

Furthermore, our students took charge of the Science events and imparted their knowledge that they have learnt in E2K Science to the greater masses at school. In 2022, PGPS E2K Science YouTube channel was launched. - [PGPSE2KSC](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCd5MBo0wkVcbB6Mn-ewtlDg/videos)

In addition, we had a bumper crop of students taking part in the Science Buskers Competition in 2023. Organised by the A*STAR and Singapore Science Centre, the competition aims to promote learning of Science in an engaging way as well as generating greater interest in creative Science and communications and expressions. Out of more than 200 teams from various schools which participated, 2 teams from PGPS were among the 25 teams shortlisted!

We are proud to announce that our teams clinched Champion (Primary Category) and the People’s Choice award (Best Science Communication). Following up their stellar performance at the competition, our teams were invited to perform at a community event for Punggol West CC and the World Robotics Competition.

In 2024, our students demonstrated exceptional initiative by authoring and illustrating "Pearl's Recycling Adventures" for the National Sustainability Movement. This challenge aims to foster a generation of eco-stewards and take actions in promoting a culture of sustainability in the school and community. To promote environmental awareness, they conducted outreach programmes at MOE Kindergarten and NLB at One Punggol, sharing their book with young children and facilitating interactive sustainability-themed activities. We are proud to announce that their outstanding efforts were recognized with a Gold award in the Sustainability Advocacy Challenge.

With multiple invitations to perform in public, our students showcased their craft with poise and charm, sharing their science mastery and skills to the community. Aligned to the 21st Enhanced CC framework, our students are developing into confident individuals.
