**<font size=5>English Language</font>**

It has been said that the English Language can only be understood “**_through tough_**, **_thorough thought_**”. **_Though_** some may hence see the learning of the language as difficult (there are 5 ways just to pronounce ‘**_-ough_**’! Ouch!), we appreciate it as a fun challenge and this is the spirit that we hope to inculcate in our students!

To produce eloquent and confident students with a strong appreciation of the English Language
