It has been said that the English Language can only be understood “<b>thr<u>ough</u> t<u>ough</u></b>, <b>thor<u>ough</u> th<u>ough</u>t</b>”. <b>Th<u>ough</u></b> some may hence see the learning of the language as difficult (there are 5 ways just to pronounce ‘<b>-ough</b>’! Ouch!), we appreciate it as a fun challenge and this is the spirit that we hope to inculcate in our students!<br><br>

<b>Vision</b><br>
To produce eloquent and confident students with a strong appreciation of the English Language<br><br>

<b>Mission</b><br>
To provide a rich curriculum that is enabling, engaging and enriching<br><br>
