**<font size="5">Overview of Social Studies</font>**<br>
Social Studies prepares our students to be effective citizens by helping them to better understand the interconnectedness of Singapore and the world they live in and appreciate the complexities of the human experience. It seeks to ignite students’ curiosity to inquire into real-world issues that concern their lives. Through inquiry and authentic learning experiences, Social Studies helps students to attain relevant knowledge and understanding about these issues, develop critical and reflective thinking skills, and appreciate multiple perspectives.

**<font size="5">Mission and Stage Outcomes of Social Studies</font>**<br>
To develop students to be engaged citizens through inquiry-based learning. <br>

Working hand-in-hand with CCE, the Social Studies curriculum aims to invoke the Singapore spirit and prepare them to be effective citizens through customised lessons and programmes.

*   <u>Orientation Stage (P1 - 2)</u>

Students at this stage learn to be aware of their own identity and their immediate environment. They explore the different roles that they play and understand how their actions can affect the people and places around them.

*   <u>Exploration Stage (P3 - 4)</u>

As the students progress, they get to know more about Singapore’s past and present as well as what to expect for the future. They learn to appreciate Singapore’s achievements and explore ways to contribute back to the society to build a better future for Singapore.  

*   <u>Mastery Stage (P5 - 6)</u>

Students continue to understand Singapore’s development as a nation through the National Symbols, events and places. They then continue to embark on a journey to understand the interconnectedness of Singapore and the world they live in.


**<font size="5">Learning in authentic settings</font>**<br>
Social Studies learning extends beyond the walls of the classroom where students are exposed to authentic real-world settings through learning journeys. They learn to explore the surroundings, construct new knowledge and make connections to the topic being studied.
