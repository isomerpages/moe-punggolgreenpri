<b>Department Mission</b><br>
To nurture, develop and support students with learning needs by working together with the teachers, parents and peers.<br><br>

<b>Overview of SEN@PGPS</b><br>
At PGPS, we remain committed to providing ongoing support for students facing learning or behavioral challenges, assisting them in excelling not only in their academic pursuits but also in co-curricular activities and character development.<br><br>

<b>What are Special Educational Needs (SEN)?</b><br>
A student with special educational needs may encounter challenges in learning and/or behavior that surpass those typically faced by children of the same age. These challenges can manifest in various aspects, including difficulties in social interactions, language acquisition, academic performance, or physical abilities.<br><br>
The student might face challenges in various areas, including:
<br>

<ul>
   <li>Completing school assignments</li>
   <li>Reading and writing</li>
   <li>Communicating with peers and others</li>
	 <li>Establishing and maintaining friendships</li>
 <li>Exhibiting appropriate behavior in social settings</li>
<li>Engaging in learning at school due to limitations in sight, hearing, or physical mobility<br></li></ul>


Every student is unique. Even if two students share the same diagnosis, their learning and support needs can vary significantly, and they may progress at different rates.<br><br>
