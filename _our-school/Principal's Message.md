</p><p>Punggol Green Primary School is a community built on the strong belief that every child can flourish. We believe that success isn't just about natural talent, but about the heart and determination a student brings to their journey. By fostering a positive attitude and a resilient spirit, we aim to show every student that their hard work is the most powerful tool they have to reach new heights, so they will strive to be the best that they can be.</p>
<p>Our identity is shaped by our school’s core values of Self-Discipline, Teamwork, Responsibility, Integrity, Valour and Empathy. We strive to nurture students who are not only eager to learn but are also compassionate individuals who choose to do the right thing even when no one is watching. Our vision : <b>Future-Ready Leaders With The Heart For Others</b> is a promise to provide a safe, joyful space where children can discover their potential and grow into leaders who care deeply for the world around them.</p>
<p>This journey is a shared one, fueled by the dedication of our teachers and the vital partnership of our parents. We invite families to walk alongside us with trust and mutual respect, keeping our common goal at heart: the well-being and growth of your children. Together, by turning small acts of excellence into daily habits, we can ensure that 2026 is a year of meaningful growth and lasting joy for every member of our school family.</p>
