The school crest embodies the school’s aspirations. The rising orange Sun symbolizes the bright and vibrant future the pupils strive for,  guided by the 6 rays of the Sun which represent the school’s 6 core values of <b>S</b>elf-discipline, <b>T</b>eamwork, <b>R</b>esponsibility, <b>I</b>ntegrity, <b>V</b>alour and <b>E</b>mpathy. The blue Globe underscores the school’s vision of developing leaders of tomorrow who care, and are rooted to Singapore yet have a global outlook. The figurine reaching for the star serves as a reminder to pupils to set their targets high and be the best that they can be in everything that they do, in order to achieve success in life. The green colour signifies the school’s desire to contribute to environmental sustainability and conservation.<br><br>
