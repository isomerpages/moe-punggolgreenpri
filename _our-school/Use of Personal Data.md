<p style="line-height:1.3;font-family:arial;font-size:16px;text-align:justify;">Photograph(s) or video image(s) of students and parents/guardians of PGPS may be captured during any school activities/events such as classroom lessons, CCA, school camps, Annual Award ceremonies, etc. The school may use and publish such photographs and/or video recordings in school publications, website, social media channels, and other communication channels. </p>

<p style="line-height:1.3;font-family:arial;font-size:16px;text-align:justify;word-spacing:0.15em;">Withdrawal of consent for the use of photograph(s) and video image(s) can be made by parents/guardians via email to the school at <a href="mailto:admin_punggolgreen_ps@moe.edu.sg">admin_punggolgreen_ps@moe.edu.sg</a></p>

<p style="line-height:1.3;font-family:arial;font-size:16px;text-align:justify;word-spacing:0.15em;">To safeguard student privacy and data security, photography and videography are strictly prohibited within the school premises. This applies to all parents and visitors for consistent implementation. The restriction covers all areas within the school compound, including common spaces such as the foyer and during dismissal times. For official school events (e.g. concerts and prize-giving ceremonies), the school may designate specific photo and video-taking opportunities and zones, which will be clearly communicated prior to each event.</p>
