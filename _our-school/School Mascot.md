TREVIS the Wolf was launched as the school mascot in 2022 as part of the school’s 10th year anniversary as it espouses the school’s core values of Self-discipline, Teamwork, Responsibility, Integrity, Valour and Empathy.

We hope that TREVIS will play an integral role in enriching our students’ school lives, as he serves to unite our students, enhance their learning experiences, and strengthen their sense of identity and belonging to the school. To evoke school pride and spirit, TREVIS will be a familiar figure at our school events and an avid supporter for our school teams at competitions.<br><br>
