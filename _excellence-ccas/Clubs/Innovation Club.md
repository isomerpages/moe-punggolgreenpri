**<font size=6>Innovation Club</font>**

Innovation is an important skill that will better prepare our students to thrive in future challenges and dynamism. At Punggol Green Primary School, our Innovation club believes that the essence of innovation lies in moulding an attitude and outlook of creativity and initiative in our students. We not only aim to develop critical and inventive thinking skills in our students, but also actively encourage them to be ‘risk-takers’ through different platforms and opportunities.
