<p style="line-height:1.3; font-size:16px; font-family:Arial; text-align:justify;"><b>Water Efficiency Awards 2024</b><br><br>We are proud to announce that our school has received the prestigious Water Efficiency Award 2024, recognizing our comprehensive approach to water sustainability through initiatives such as reducing water consumption, implementing water-saving technologies, and fostering environmental responsibility among students and staff. Our Environmental Education Programme encourages students to develop alternative water recycling tools like aquaponics, while student leaders spread awareness to kindergarten children and families. The Parents Support Group and teachers support students in activities such as World Water Day, and water conservation posters are displayed prominently throughout the school. We have implemented water-efficient fixtures, a QR-code-based fault reporting system, and monthly water consumption monitoring to ensure efficiency and timely resolution of issues. This award reflects our dedication to sustainability and our positive impact on the environment.</p>
