The PGPS English Drama Club provides members with opportunities to explore various drama techniques as well as design, stage and craft their own productions. Through our own productions, the English Drama Club sees not only the growth of actors but also of scriptwriters. Most importantly, students also learn to respect one another during performances. 

Camaraderie among students is cultivated through the facilitation of warm-up sessions led by students and the inclusion of outdoor learning experiences. This is a fun and interesting CCA where students express their creativity through the various drama skills such as Tableaux, Improvisation, Script Writing and Monologues. Students will also have the opportunities to learn more about stage management and prop production.
