<p style="line-height:1.3;font-size:16px;font-family:Arial;text-align:justify;">I-STEM Club is a CCA that engages students in the four specific disciplines - science, technology, engineering and mathematics, in an interdisciplinary approach. Through this I-STEM CCA, we hope students would be inspired to be innovative and critical thinkers with a heart for others and care for the environment.</p>

<p style="line-height:1.3;font-size:16px;font-family:Arial;text-align:justify;">STEM education aims to prepare students for careers in fields related to science, technology, engineering and mathematics by integrating these subjects into a cohesive learning paradigm. The goal is to develop critical thinking, problem-solving skills and creativity among students.</p>

<p style="line-height:1.3;font-size:16px;font-family:Arial;text-align:justify;">By exposing students to STEM and giving them opportunities to explore STEM-related concepts, we hope that students will develop a passion for it. Our CCA is packed with STEM activities, such as Design Challenge with Magicbit, Game development using coding, hands-on engineering activities and solar-generated toys. During the game development, students learn computational thinking, basic coding skills and 21st century skills such as communication, critical thinking, creativity and collaboration. Applying these skills learnt into real-life situations will help students to better understand the challenges faced by the environment.</p>

<p style="line-height:1.3;font-size:16px;font-family:Arial;text-align:justify;">In I-STEM Club, we aim to develop every student to become adaptive and inventive thinkers capable of solving real world problems with practical solutions. Inventive thinkers explore possibilities and generate novel and useful ideas with useful solutions. Adaptive thinkers are resilient and resourceful as they adjust their perspectives and strategies to achieve their goals. We strive to have every student become a creator, connector and contributor.</p>
