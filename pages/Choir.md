We are a unique ensemble because we sing using the instrument that we are gifted with... Our voices! We are passionate about singing and performing and aim to provide a platform for students to showcase their talents and hard work. <br> 

We start with vocal warm-up activities and participate in multi-part singing that blends beautifully into one song. We also delve deeper into music elements with fun activities to substantiate our music-learning. We are also exposed to a wide repertoire of songs from different cultures. <br>
