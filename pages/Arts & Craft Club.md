Arts &amp; Craft Club gathers passionate young artists to come together to learn more about Art. <br>
We aim to:-
<ul>
   <li>nurture creativity and self-expression</li>
   <li>foster a deeper love and appreciation for the Arts</li>
   <li>encourage the holistic development of the students anchored in the vision and mission of the school</li></ul>

Throughout the year, students hone their skills and techniques through various art forms and mediums beyond the formal art curriculum. Drawing, painting, pottery and craftwork are just some examples of what students will learn. <p>
Apart from mastering their artistic inclinations, they will also build strong characters as they learn to work together, share ideas and help one another whilst forging new friendships. Arts &amp; Craft Club members will also cultivate values such as respect and resilience through their art-making journey
