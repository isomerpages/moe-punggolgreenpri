Football, Soccer, Fútbol - or by any other name around the world – is also known as “The People's Game”. A sport accessible to everyone and enjoyed by millions worldwide. <p>
Similarly, here in PGPS, we aim to make football a sport enjoyed by as many people as possible. In addition to footballing skills, concepts and knowledge, our students will also experience opportunities to practice our PGPS STRIVE Values in real-life settings: both on, and off, the pitch.
