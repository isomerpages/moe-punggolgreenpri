Hi ex-students of PGPS,

We hope this message finds you well. We'd like to inform you that our school compound will be used for Presidential Election purposes, and preparations will commence on this Wednesday, 30 August 2023. Many school facilities will be out of bound from Wednesday afternoon onward. In light of this, we kindly request our ex-students refrain from visiting the school premises during this period. Your understanding is greatly appreciated. Thank you for your cooperation!
