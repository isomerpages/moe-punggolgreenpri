**Caring Teachers Award 2024**

Dear parents,

In conjunction with Teachers’ Day celebration for 2023, NIE has launched the Caring Teacher Awards (CTA) 2024. 

The CTA aims to acknowledge teachers in our school who go beyond the call of duty, nurturing the holistic development of their students and ensuring their charges grow up to be confident, independent and resilient learners for our nation. Please refer to the attachments for details of the nomination criteria.

All students, parents, teachers and principals can now visit the CTA website at [www.cta.nie.edu.sg](https://www.cta.nie.edu.sg/) to nominate teachers who exemplify the values of caring for the academic, moral, social, emotional and mental welfare of their students. Alternatively, hard copy nomination form is made available to you at the school’s General Office counter.

You may also go to the school website for the above information on all staff nomination awards under the heading ‘Our Partners in Education’.

Closing date for nominations is **12 January 2024**
