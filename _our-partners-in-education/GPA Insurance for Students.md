**Group Personal Accident (GPA) Insurance for Students** <br>
The Ministry of Education (MOE) has established a contract for GPA Insurance for Students. This contract is awarded to NTUC Income Insurance Co-operative Limited.

**Parents/guardian will have to pay for medical treatments upfront, before submitting claims to Income Insurance Limited (Income Insurance) for reimbursement. Please note the applicable limits and coverage for medical expenses. Ineligible expenses or expenses in excess of the limits will be borne by the students/parents/guardian.**
