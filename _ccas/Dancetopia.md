'Dancetopia', our PGPS Dance Club, was officially formed in 2015. The cornerstone of our identity as a dance club has always been Contemporary Dance. Our club aims to develop dancers that emulate our PGPS' STRIVE values through the training of specific dance skills and routines as well as character building activities. 

Dancers participate in a variety of performances and competitions to gain experience and build their confidence as they fulfill their potential talent. 

Our dance sessions include training students in developing the elemental skills and routines such as:
<li>strengthening and lengthening muscles</li>
<li>	increasing memory, balance, core stability &amp; flexibility</li>
<li>	improving coordination, musicality and rhythm </li>
<li>and above all introducing students to the joy of dance</li>

Under the guidance and facilitation of both our teachers and instructors, students work in groups to hone their dance skills at the same time nurture their creativity while transforming balance and posture into a style of expressive dance fusing elements of lyrical, ballet and jazz.
